# MTA Turnstile EDA

### Description
In this project, we analyze turnstile data in New York City by the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) to assist the Women Tech Women Yes (WTWY) in maximizing attendance at its annual gala and increasing awareness around the organization's efforts to increase the participation of women in technology. Additionally, we analyze income tax data for NYC provided by the IRS to further understand the target demographic of people who work in tech and ride the subway to and from work each day.

### Target Variables
The target variables for this project include daily turnstile entries across the top 10 busiest subway locations, as well as higher income families and tech companies and their proximity to subway stations.

### Data Used
We used turnstile data from the MTA for 6 separate weeks over the first 6 months of the 2020 to include the weeks of: January 18, February 8, March 21, April 11, May 30, and June 6. The data can be retrieved here:

We also used Individual Income Tax Statistics from the IRS for 2018 in NYC. The data can be retrieved here:

We used this article detailing top-funded NYC start-up zip codes to create one of our graphs and to locate stations in those same zip codes:

* Jupyter
* MATPLOTLIB
* Seaborn
* Pandas

### Possible Impacts of the Project
The information we obtained can be used by organizations such as WTWY to place street teams at subway stations that are likely to gain the most signatures from individuals interested in tech. The information can also be used to further focus in on the target demographic such as the percentage by station or location that are women and their average age and the time of day that sees the greatest traffic.
